# my-portfolio
A portfolio that shows my progress from the last graduation project till now (2023/07 ~ current).\
I really enjoyed making my portfolio, spent about 3 days making it (designing and building), but I didn't realise time went so quick.

Thank you so much for the visit, if you are curious please have a read below on how I implemented my portfolio website.

The tools I used: TypeScript, React, Framer Motion, hello-pangea/dnd, styled-components, Firebase, HTML, CSS

## Intro.tsx
The very first component you see when this website is accessed.\
I used hello-pangea/dnd to implement dragging key to the lock feature which "unlocks" the rest of the webpage.

## Me.tsx
Basic information about myself. Experience, Education, Goals and Skills.\
Character Image generated by AR Zone by Samsung Galaxy and used styled-components for CSS.

## Porjects.tsx
This component outlines all of my completed projects and displayed projects are projects that I'd call a major project. \
Such as a graduation team project, famous website clones.

All the projects are stored as an array of objects in a separate file called project-list.tsx. Used styled-components for CSS.

All the sub projects are displayed in a small boxes and each of the boxes have links to its GitHub and live demo pages.\
Framer Motion's AnimatePresence was used to animate the movement of the Slider feature. (See below for demonstration)

## Board.tsx
This component allows the website visitors to write comments, those comments can be seen by anyone who accesses it.\
